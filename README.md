# GeRuMap App  

GeRuMap is a simple **Java desktop application** (developed using the **Maven framework**) created as part of the university subject **"Software Design"**.  

The main goal of this project was to practice **MVC architecture** and implement different **design patterns**, including:  
- Singleton  
- Observer  
- State pattern  
- Command pattern  
- Composite pattern  
- Factory Method  

This desktop app is designed to create **Mind Maps** that support studying and organizing ideas.  
Users can group maps into projects, create their own styles or templates, and export their work for later use.

## Features  

- **Project management**: create and organize projects containing multiple mind maps  
- **Mind Map creation**: design maps without predefined templates; optionally use custom user-defined templates  
- **Topic & Association management**:  
  - Add new topics (keywords representing logical units of information)  
  - Connect topics with associations (lines that build hierarchy and logical structure)  
- **Editing tools**:  
  - Move topics around the map  
  - Edit text and colors of elements  
  - Center the map around a selected topic  
- **Import & Export options**:  
  - Import existing maps  
  - Save maps as editable projects for future work  
  - Export maps as images or templates for reuse

## Purpose  

GeRuMap demonstrates how **design patterns** and the **MVC architecture** can be applied in real-world applications.  
It provides a simple but effective tool for creating visual study aids while showcasing important software design principles.
